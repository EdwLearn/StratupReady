# Wine Quality

This project is a data analysis aimed at exploring and understanding the components that influence wine quality. The analysis is conducted using Jupyter notebooks on Deepnote.

## Project Description

In an effort to understand the components that influence wine quality, several interesting questions are posed to uncover better insights in the data. Different types of graphs are utilized to facilitate understanding of the results.

## Gain Deeper Insight

For a more detailed understanding of this project and to explore the insights obtained, we invite you to access the Jupyter notebook on Deepnote. [Click here to access the project!](https://edwlearn.super.site/projects/wine-data-exploration-variability-and-quality-analysis)

## Cloning the Repository
